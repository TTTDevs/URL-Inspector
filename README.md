# URL Inspector (beta)

A simple app that helps clearly visualize and perform some cleanup on shared URLs before opening them in the browser.

It's intended to help prevent some cases of phishing where an attacker sends a URL that looks legit until a closer look is taken, or for when the user opens a link from an image or other elements that don't clearly show the destination URL.

## TODO
- Unshorten URLs
- Add format/colors to different parts of the shared URL (Example: HTTP = RED).

## Bugs
- Probably a lot.
